I will display all the visualization that I made here since Github unable to display my data visualization :smile:

##### Objective 1: To determine the frequency of customer membership status purchases by product gender

##### Objective 2: To identify the quantity purchases by gender and product category

##### Objective 3: To identify quantity purchases by gender and product brand

##### Objective 4: To determine total sales by agent id name and product brand

##### Objective 5: To analyse total sales by date

We can move the date slider to our preference date

##### Objective 6: To analyse the average total sales by date and customer membership status
![Scenario 6: Across columns](/images/projects/avebydateandcust.png)

##### Objective 7: To analyse average total sales by date and agent id name
![Scenario 7: Across columns](/images/projects/avebydateandagent.png)

##### Objective 8: To analyse average total sales by date and gender
![Scenario 8: Across columns](/images/projects/avebydateandgend.png)

##### Objective 9: To identify favourable purchase time by product brand
![Scenario 9: Across columns](/images/projects/favour.png)

We can choose product brand by clicking on the dropdown list. However this visualization need an improvement since the time does not fully show.
